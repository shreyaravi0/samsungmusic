📘 Project Overview - 

The Music Generator is an AI-powered creative tool that synthesizes original musical compositions from text prompts, images, or even humming audio inputs.

It bridges the gap between linguistic, visual, and acoustic creativity, allowing users to express emotions, moods, and themes through music generated dynamically using deep learning models.
